      <h2>Issue</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
        <ul>
          <li>
            During making the header of the home page, I could not figure out how to put
            the title and the button link to the about page at two sides of the header. After
            reviewing the class slides and searching on google, I used float to accomplish
            effect. However, other elements will overlap with the floating elements and 
            mess up the arrangement of the page. I solved this problem by add a clear div
            to remove the floating condition of the elements afterwards.
          </li>
          <li>
            The way I would like to arrange my home page is to place my short intro and my
            photo horizontally and put a button to download my resume at the botton of the
            intro. I solve it also by searching on the internet and using the absolute
            position and changed the left margin to make it resposive to the size change of
            the browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            I would like to add a hover effect to the projects on the home page that shows
            the title of the projects when mouse hovering. To accomplish this effect, I 
            also used to absolute postion to make the project title overlap with the project
            picture. The problem of this hovering effect is to make the two elements both
            change opacity when the mouse hovering. I searched on the internet and found
            out that when the relationship of the elements are different, the sybol used to
            connect them are also different. When one of the elements is after the other, we
            need to use "+", when there are other elements between them, we should use "~",
            and when one element is a descendant of the other, we can just use a space.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
      <ol>
        <li>
          The hovering state of the projects. The picture of the project will disapper and
          the title of the proeject will show up when mouse hovering. I choose to use it is
          because I want to show the title of each projects directly on the home page to make
          it clear to the users. I use hover state in the CSS file to make it work.
        </li>
        <img alt="css transition" class="gif" src="MP0 CSS Transition.gif"/>
        <li>
          The button transition comes from the Internet https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples
          It will add drop shadow when hovering. I choose it in order to make the users know this
          button can click.

      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add more projects from my previous experience and create more project sections on my home 
            page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make the header appear on all the pages and add a footer that also appears on all pages.
            The header needs to be sticky which will always show on the top of the page. The footer
            will show my contact information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a back to home page button on every projects page. Maybe also another button directs
            to the next projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add some animation to the web pages by using Javascript.
