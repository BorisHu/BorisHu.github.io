      <div class="section-container">
          <p>
            I would like to combine this project with the HCDE 438 project 
            to make a bullet hell web-game that the character could be controlled 
            by the joystick and buttons. The HP of the character will be displayed 
            on the seven segment display, the score of the player will be showed 
            on the 4 digit seven-segment display.
          </p>

      <h2>Timeline and contingency plans:</h2>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 7%;">
        <ul>
          <li>
            By March 2nd: Try using each electronic parts for tasks to prepare for 
            the project.
          </li>
          <li>
            By March 3rd: Finish coding part of the bullet hell game made by P5.js 
            and connect to arduino.
          </li>
          <li>
            By March 7th: Build the Physical Prototype and test each electronic part 
            work with the game. Debug in class.
          </li>
          <li>
            By March 9th: Final Presentation, webpage documentation.
          </li>

        <h4>
          Plan B:
        </h4>
        <p>
          If something goes wrong with using physical parts to control or display 
          information in the game, I will choose to use the computer keys or display.
