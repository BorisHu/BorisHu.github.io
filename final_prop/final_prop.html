      <h2>Project Concept:</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
          <p>
            I would like to combine the final projects of HCDE 438 and HCDE 439
            to make a bullet hell web-game that the character could be controlled 
            by the joystick and buttons. The HP of the character will be displayed 
            on the seven segment display, the score of the player will be showed 
            on the 4 digit seven-segment display. I will use P5.js to make a bullet 
            hell game and use Firebase to store the player's score of each game.
          </p>

      <h2>Version Description</h2>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 5%;">
        <h3>Prototype Version</h3>
        <p>
          Limited game features with basic firebase storing userdata such as userID 
          and score. The game part and the firebase part maybe seperated. Game 
          calculate score by it own. Input the score hardcoded to firebase. 
          Style CSS may not included. Electronic parts work to input some values 
          and return to arduino score value.
        </p>
        <h3>Final Version</h3>
        <p>
          Refined interface and appearance. The score of the game direct input to 
          firebase. Arduino electronic parts able to control the character of the 
          game.

      <h2>Timeline and Plans:</h2>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 7%;">
        <ol>
          <li>
            By March 2nd: Try using each electronic parts for tasks to prepare for 
            the project. Learn Firebase Libiary features.
          </li>
          <li>
            By March 5th: Finish coding part of the bullet hell game made by P5.js 
            and connect to arduino.
          </li>
          <li>
            By March 7th: Build the Physical Prototype and test each electronic part 
            work with the game. Debug in class.
          </li>
          <li>
            By March 9th: Final Presentation, webpage documentation.

          Plan B:
        </h3>
        <p>
          If something goes wrong with using physical parts to control or display 
          information in the game, I will choose to use the computer keys or display.
        </p>
      <h3>Stretch goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Add more features to Game such as more enemies and Bosses</li>
        <li>Replace Login page with login section on gaming page.</li>
