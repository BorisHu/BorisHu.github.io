        <h1>Think Broadly. Design Inclusively.</h1>
        <h3 class="intro-paragraph">
          I am currently a student majoring in Human-Centered Design 
          and Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle. 
          Suffering from ankylosing spondylitis, I pay special 
          attention to disabilities and accessibility facilities 
          and services in my designs. I seek to design solutions 
          for people in marginalized communities and create 
          satisfying experiences that could help them to increase 
          convenience in their lives.<br>
          <br>With these expectations, I would like to learn more 
          innovative design and engineering skills as well as 
          practical abilities to help me to achieve my ambitions.
