      <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
          <p>
            In this project, I made a chrome web extension that could change the current tab 
            to incognito mode, also it will delete the browser history of this tab.
            To use this web extension, load unpacked web extension in the chrome extensions 
            page. Then, on the tab you want to change to incognito, click the button in the 
            extension section on the top right corner of the brower.
          </p>

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
        <ol>
          <li>
            I have first look through the chrome developer page of creating new windows and 
            clearing brower history. Watched some youtube tuturial videos to about creating 
            web extensions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then I have looked up for example project on github to see if there is similar 
            ones that could inspire my thought.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, I modified the code to accomplish my goal that switch current tab to 
            incognito and delete history.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
        <ul>
          <li>
            The biggest problem I have encountered is when opening a new incognito window, chrome will 
            open a blank page with error message that I don't have the permission. This is probally a 
            logic error since the syntax is correct according to VS code.
          </li>
          <li>
            In order to solve this issue, I choose to go through the tuturials on chrome developers page, 
            MDN web docs, and video tuturial on youtube to better understand the logic of the kind of web 
            extension I am trying to make. Also, the most helpful method is to learn from the existing 
            projects on github with similar features.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Add a new feature that could close the current tab so the users don't need to switch to normal 
            mode and close it by themselves. This requires get current tab method and remove method.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a new option to execute the extension when right click on current tab. This requires to use 
            contextMenus method and needs more permission.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
