      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
          <p>I have created a schematic for 3 LEDs connected to my Arduino, and I also 
            implemented it as a circuit on my breadboard. I have also write firmware for 
            the circuit that makes the LEDs blink in a pattern.</p>

      <h2>Schematic</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
        <ol>
          <li>
            I have first calculated the appropriate resistance for each LEDs. The blue LED
            has a different voltage drop with the red and yellow LEDs. I calculated them 
            separately.
          </li>

          <li>
            Then with the value of resistor, I have drew the schematic for the circuit.

      <!-- <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
      <div class="section-container">

          The hovering state of the projects. The picture of the project will disapper and
          the title of the proeject will show up when mouse hovering. I choose to use it is
          because I want to show the title of each projects directly on the home page to make
          it clear to the users. I use hover state in the CSS file to make it work.
        </li>

        <li>
          The button transition comes from the Internet https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples
          It will add drop shadow when hovering. I choose it in order to make the users know this
          button can click.

      <h2>Circuit</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
        <p>
          According to the schematic, I have built the circuit with Arduino on the breadboard.
