      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
          <p>I have created a schematic for 3 LEDs connected to my Arduino, and I also 
            implemented it as a circuit on my breadboard. I have also write firmware for 
            the circuit that makes the LEDs blink in a pattern.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            I have first calculated the appropriate resistance for each LEDs. The blue LED
            has a different voltage drop with the red and yellow LEDs. I calculated them 
            separately.

          <li>
            Then with the value of resistor, I have drew the schematic for the circuit.

        <p>
          According to the schematic, I have built the circuit with Arduino on the breadboard.
