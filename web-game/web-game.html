      <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
          <p>
            In this project, I made a simple bullet hell game that could run on an website. I have 
            practiced to use the modern web development toolchain to structure and deploy an 
            app which includes external dependencies. I have mainly use the p5 and p5.play libraries 
            to make the game.

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
        <ol>
          <li>
            First, I followed the class activity to initialize the develop toolchain to build the 
            environment for me the make the game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, I have gone through the p5.play tuturial website and watched several videos on youtube 
            to have an basic undersanting of p5.play.
          </li>
          <li>
            Then I have tried all the different functions on p5 editor and use them to first build 
            the structure of he game.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, I solved the problems I encountered and created my own simple game.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
        <ol>
          <li>
            The first problem I have encountered is the rollup plugin I used to bundle the code is creating 
            an empty JavaScript file in the dist folder which will cause the page deployed show nothing.
            <ul>
              <li>
                By following Hannah's instruction in the discord server, I have changed to not use the node 
                resolve plugin and use the direct import in the HTML files.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The second problem I encountered is the sprites I have created in the "draw" function could not 
            interact with other sprites. After debugging, I found out that the sprites and groups need 
            to be created in the "setup" function to enable it to interact with other elements.
            <ul>
              <li>
                After detected the problem, I changed the structure of my code and created all the sprites 
                and groups in the "setup" funtion.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <div class="section-container">
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make it looks better by changing the appearance of the player and the enemies. Fix the enemies 
            could only show one bullet problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a score count and make the health of the player become a health bar. Add more enemy bullets 
            type and movements.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
